As a former architect and urban planner transitioning to data analysis/science, I have a strong passion for data visualization. My fascination with maps and graphs drives me to uncover their hidden meanings and strive to present them in a clear and aesthetically pleasing manner. I am eager to enhance my knowledge of geospatial data. 

Currently, I am immersing myself in the world of data visualization and am always on the lookout for opportunities to collaborate with like-minded individuals. I am interested to connect with professionals in this field, and I believe that working together can produce truly outstanding results. Additionally, I am seeking guidance from experts who can offer me valuable insights on creating engaging and informative visualizations.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask me anything. And if you'd like to reach out to me, please find me on my [LinkedIn<!--<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-0077B5?style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white"/>-->](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adriana-caetano-sd/) to connect.
