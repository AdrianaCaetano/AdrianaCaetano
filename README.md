I am Adriana, a recent Master's Degree in Computer Science graduate with a passion for data. I also hold a Bachelor's Degree in Architecture and Urban Planning from Brazil. 

During my Master's program, I focused on databases, data mining, machine learning, and AI, which provided me with a strong foundation in handling data and discovering its meaning. As an architect, I have experience in understanding client needs and translating them into projects. I also have experience working as a liaison between clients, engineering teams, and builders, managing all aspects of the construction lifecycle. Through these experiences, I developed skills in collaboration, attention to detail, and project management.

People describe me as methodical, organized, personable, and a team player. I embrace challenges and changes, and I am comfortable dealing with the unknown. I have excellent communication skills and an attitude of flexibility, which I believe are essential when working with data. I am able to translate complex data into easily understandable formats, making my presentations accessible and informative to a broad range of audiences.

Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me. Please feel free to explore my portfolio to see examples of my work and projects, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like to collaborate in the future.
